#  C++ Style Guide

## Introduction

This is a suggestion of how you should develop with the C++ language.  
Style Guides are about consitency for the code and often more important in a project.

## Code in Zen Mode

Most of this rules I have learned from python phylosophy: [Zen of Python](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PythonPhilosophy .)

* Beautiful is better than ugly.
* Explicit is better than implicit.
* Simple is better than complex.
* Complex is better than complicated.
* Flat is better than nested.
* Sparse is better than dense.
* Readability counts.
* Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
* Although practicality beats purity.
* Errors should never pass silently.
* Unless explicitly silenced.
* In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
* There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    - Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
* Now is better than never.
    - Although never is often better than right now.
* If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
* If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
* NameSpaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
