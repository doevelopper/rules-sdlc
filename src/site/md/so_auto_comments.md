### [Q] Images of code/error message
Images and screenshots can be a nice addition to a post, but please make sure the post is still clear and useful without them. **Don't post images of code or error messages.** Read [why](https://meta.$SITEURL$/questions/285551/why-not-upload-images-of-code-on-so-when-asking-a-question/285557#285557). Instead copy and paste or type the actual code/message into the post directly.

### [Q] Code writing request
$SITENAME$ is **NOT** a code writing service. We are always glad to help and support new coders *but you need to help yourself first. :-)* You are expected to try to write the code yourself. Please read how to create a [mcve].

### [Q] Book, tool, library, tutorial requests
**Questions asking us to recommend or find a book, tool, software library, tutorial or other off-site resource are off-topic** for $SITENAME$ as they tend to attract opinionated answers and spam. Thus I flagged this question accordingly.

### [Q] No attempt
What have you already tried to achieve your solution? It is expected of askers to show research efforts.

### [Q] Answer added to question
Rather than edit the question to add the solution, post it as answer! [Answering your own question is not forbidden](//meta.$SITEURL$/a/250208/4733879), but [officially encouraged](//$SITEURL$/help/self-answer). (there is even an option to answer the question directly at the [Ask a Question](//$SITEURL$/questions/ask) page)

### [Q] Added "Solved" to title
Please don't add texts like "Solved" to the title. Instead, mark the most helpful answer as accepted by clicking the checkmark below the downvote button.

### [Q] Opinion-based
I'll flag this question as *primarily opinion-based*, as answers to this question will tend to be almost entirely based on opinions, rather than facts, references, or specific expertise.

### [Q] No code
Please add some code to your question, so we can better understand your question and possibly identify the issue(s). Read how to create a before adding your code.

### [Q] Wall of code
Quote from [this meta post](//meta.$SITEURL$/questions/293931/should-one-answer-terribly-poor-questions/293946#293946): "*We do not want debug-my-wall-of-code-for-me questions. Period. [...]*". Such questions are likely to get downvoted, closed and/or deleted. Try to reduce your code to a specific problem you've got by following the guidelines how to create a [mcve].

### [Q] No MCVE
Please try to reduce your code to a specific problem you've got by following the guidelines how to create a [mcve].

### [Q] Very bad question
Please read [ask].

### [Q] More than one question asked
It is preferred if you can post separate questions instead of combining your questions into one. That way, it helps the people answering your question and also others hunting for at least one of your questions.

### [Q] Code Review
Please do not ask for code review questions here on $SITENAME$. There is a Stack Exchange site [exactly for that](//codereview.stackexchange.com). Please [check if your code is suitable for migration](//codereview.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1687/what-questions-are-suitable-for-migration-to-code-review-and-how-does-the-proce).

### [A] NAAs < 50 rep
This does not provide an answer to the question. You can [search for similar questions](/search), or refer to the related and linked questions on the right-hand side of the page to find an answer. If you have a related but different question, [ask a new question](/questions/ask), and include a link to this one to help provide context. See: [Ask questions, get answers, no distractions](/tour)

### [A] NAAs > 50 rep
This post doesn't look like an attempt to answer this question. Every post here is expected to be an explicit attempt to *answer* this question; if you have a critique or need a clarification of the question or another answer, you can [post a comment](/help/privileges/comment) (like this one) directly below it. Please remove this answer and create either a comment or a new question. See: [Ask questions, get answers, no distractions](/tour)

### [A] Link Only
Please [add context around the link](//s.tk/meta/a/8259) so your fellow users will have some idea what it is and why itâ€™s there, then quote the most relevant part of the page you're linking to in case the target page is unavailable. [Answers that are little more than a link may be deleted.](/help/deleted-answers)

### [A] Comment
This does not provide an answer to the question. Once you have sufficient [reputation](/help/whats-reputation) you will be able to [comment on any post](/help/privileges/comment); instead, [provide answers that don't require clarification from the asker](//s.tk/meta/questions/214173/why-do-i-need-50-reputation-to-comment-what-can-i-do-instead).

### [A] 'Thanks!'
Please don't add _"thanks"_ as answers. They don't actually provide an answer to the question, and can be perceived as noise by its future visitors. Once you [earn](//meta.$SITEURL$/q/146472) enough [reputation](/help/whats-reputation), you will gain privileges to [upvote answers](/help/privileges/vote-up) you like. This way future visitors will see a higher vote count on that answer, and the answerer will also be rewarded with reputation points. See [Why is voting important](/help/why-vote).

### [A] 'Me too!'
Please don't add _Me too!_ as answers. It doesn't actually provide an answer to the question and can be perceived as noise by its future visitors. If you have a different but related question then [ask](/questions/ask) it (reference this one if it will help provide context). If you're interested in this specific question, you can [upvote](/help/privileges/vote-up) it or leave a [comment](/help/privileges/comment) once you have enough [reputation](/help/whats-reputation).

### [A] Code Only
While this code snippet may solve the question, [including an explanation](//s.tk/meta/questions/114762/explaining-entirely-code-based-answers) really helps to improve the quality of your post. Remember that you are answering the question for readers in the future, and those people might not know the reasons for your code suggestion. Please also try not to crowd your code with explanatory comments, this reduces the readability of both the code and the explanations!

### [A] Borderline Link-Only
This is a borderline [link-only answer](//s.tk/meta/q/8231). You should expand your answer to include as much information here, and use the link only for reference.

### [A] No affiliation disclosure
Please just note if you want to promote or recommend your own product/blog, there are some [guidelines in place](/help/promotion) for doing so. Following them will help you avoid giving the impression that you're spamming. Could you please edit to explicitly state your affiliation? (If you're not actually affiliated, it may be worth mentioning that as well.)

### [A] On-site link only
Instead of posting an answer which merely links to another answer, please instead [flag the question](/help/privileges/flag-posts) as a duplicate.

### [A] Duplicated answer to multiple questions
Please don't add [the same answer]([type here]) to multiple questions. Answer the best one and flag the rest as duplicates. See [Is it acceptable to add a duplicate answer to several questions?](//s.tk/meta/q/104227/347985)

### [Q] Non English question
Please write your question in English, since [$SITENAME$ is an English site.](//s.tk/meta/q/13676)

### [Q] Vandalism
Please do not vandalize your posts. If you believe your question is not useful or is no longer useful, it should be *deleted* instead of editing out all of the data that actually makes it a question.

Excessive promotion of a specific product/resource may be perceived by the community as **spam**. Take a look at the [help], specially [What kind of behavior is expected of users?](/help/behavior)'s last section: _Avoid overt self-promotion_. You might also be interested in [How to not be a spammer]/help/promotion) and [How do I advertise on $SITENAME$?](/help/advertising).

### [EQ] Android Studio tag misuse
The android-studio tag wiki says: "Do NOT use this tag for questions about programming for Android in general", but that's exactly what has been done here.

### [EQ] Retagged "Android Studio" to "Android"
Replaced android-studio tag with more appropriate/relevant android tag;
